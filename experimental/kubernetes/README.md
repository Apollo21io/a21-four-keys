# Experimental Alternative Installer for Kubernetes
This is a very early-stage attempt to create configs/instructions for installing Four Keys to a Kubernetes cluster of your choice.

A great solution here will be one in which Four Keys can be installed either to serverless (ie the current model) or Kubernetes, with maximal reuse of application code and config between these paths.

To install:
1. [configure kubectl]
1. ???
1. kubectl apply -f k8s
1. ???

Notes:
- Is KubeMQ a good solution for the Pub/Sub queue?
